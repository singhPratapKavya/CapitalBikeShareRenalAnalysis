# INTRODUCTION
Living in a city can present a significant transportation challenge, particularly due to the high volume of cars on the road and the resulting traffic congestion. To combat these issues, many citizens are turning to alternative forms of transportation. One such alternative is cycling, which is becoming increasingly popular due to its health benefits and its eco-friendly nature. Understanding the factors that influence individuals' decisions to cycle is an interesting and valuable task.

The Capital Bikeshare company has made this kind of analysis possible by sharing data on bike rental behavior in Washington D.C. The CapitalBikeShareRentalAnalysis repository contains a data analysis that aims to understand the behavior of people who rented bikes in Washington D.C. between 2012 and 2018. By utilizing this data, the project aims to gain insight into the factors that influence individuals' decisions to cycle, as well as to understand overall trends in bike rental behavior in the city.
